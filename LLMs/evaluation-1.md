Prompt engineering is a crucial aspect of training language models (LLMs) effectively. One common technique is fewshot learning, where the prompt includes a few examples, aiming for the LLM to generalize from them. Let's delve into this technique using an illustrative example of scoring text controversy.
Consider a project where we aim to assign a controversy score to texts. This score ranges from 0 to 10, indicating the level of controversy within the text. To illustrate this in a prompt, we provide several examples with their corresponding controversy scores:
Example: Controversy Scorer
Given a text, give it a controversy score from 0 to 10.
Examples:
"1 + 1 = 2"
Controversy score: 0
"Starting April 15th, only verified accounts on Twitter will be eligible to be in For You recommendations"
Controversy score: 5
"Everyone has the right to own and use guns"
Controversy score: 9
"Immigration should be completely banned to protect our country"
Controversy score: 10
The response format:
Controversy score: { score }
Reason: { reason }
This prompt sets the stage for the LLM to understand the task and generalize from the provided examples. However, two crucial questions arise:
Does the LLM comprehend the examples in the prompt?
Does the LLM overfit to these fewshot examples?
To address the first question, we can input the same examples and check if the model outputs the expected scores. If not, it indicates that the prompt may not be clear, necessitating a rewrite or breaking down the task into smaller subtasks.
For the second question, we evaluate the model on separate examples to assess if it overfits to the fewshot examples provided.
Additionally, soliciting examples from the model for specific labels can further enhance our understanding of its capabilities. For instance, asking the model to provide examples for which it would assign a score of 4 allows us to validate its responses.
In the next blog post, we'll explore techniques to refine prompts and mitigate potential challenges in fewshot learning.
Blog Post 2: Implementation of Fewshot Learning in Prompt Engineering
In the realm of prompt engineering, fewshot learning emerges as a powerful technique to train language models (LLMs). Let's delve into the implementation aspect using Python code examples.
To begin, we create a function to evaluate the performance of our LLM based on the prompt provided. Here's a Python function eval_prompt to achieve this:
python
Copy code
from llm import OpenAILLM


def eval_prompt(examples_file, eval_file):
 prompt = get_prompt(examples_file) # Retrieve prompt from file
 model = OpenAILLM(prompt=prompt, temperature=0) # Initialize LLM with prompt
 compute_rmse(model, examples_file) # Evaluate LLM on examples from file
 compute_rmse(model, eval_file) # Evaluate LLM on separate evaluation examples


In this function:
examples_file contains the fewshot examples with expected controversy scores.
eval_file comprises additional examples for evaluating the model's performance beyond the fewshot examples.
We utilize the OpenAILLM class from the llm module, initializing it with our prompt and setting the temperature parameter to 0 for deterministic outputs.
The compute_rmse function computes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the model's predicted controversy scores and the ground truth scores, facilitating model evaluation.
By executing eval_prompt("fewshot_examples.txt", "eval_examples.txt"), we can assess our LLM's performance on both the provided fewshot examples and separate evaluation examples.
This implementation showcases how Python and LLM libraries can be leveraged to operationalize prompt engineering techniques, facilitating efficient model training and evaluation.
