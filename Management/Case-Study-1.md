## A Typical Presentation
Here's a common Manager situation: 
You've gone into 1:1s with two individuals, let's call them Bob and Brenda.  Bob is new to the team and Brenda is a veteren.

In the beginning you (the manager) knew that Bob was going to need ramping when he started with the team.  You encouraged the team to collaborate and help him and Brenda has been an eager and helpful member.

Over time, you and with the rest of the team have noticed a harder edge to Brenda's slack responses to Bob's questions.  Tension is rising, as other team members report tension in team pairing sessions.  Specifics are frustratingly sparse when you ask "Can you describe what that conversation looks like"

You've started addressing the issue in 1:1s with Bob and Brenda.  Brenda reports feeling frustrated by Bob who is seems to need an inordinate amount of help.  Bob reports not feeling listened to, feeling a loss of agency in general and disconnected from the work and team.

## The Common Solution: Ever More Specific Processes!
You're first gut reaction is to suggest some processes to help Bob.  For example, one thing you heard from Brenda is that Bob's questions have been answered before sometimes in slack 5 minutes before he reasks and it's been distracting for her to continuously re-answer the same question.  She came with examples of those slacks, and you can see how it's frustrating!

You suggest implementing a running Google Doc with answers to questions and instructing Bob to check that Doc first before asking the question.

Then, Bob reports that the recorded answers in that Google Doc are not helpful and once accidentally brought down his whole dev stack.  When you looked at the Google Doc, you can see yes some of the instructions Brenda has contributed ARE wrong and Bob did waste a whole afternoon rebuilding his Dev Stack after following instructions in the Google Doc.

You see that part of the frustration for both Bob and Brenda is the async nature in their communication.  Maybe the gap between Bob's question and Brenda's response is too much context switching, and when you ask Brenda and Bob if the context switching is a problem, they agree.

So now you organize 15 minute syncs twice a week with Bob and Brenda where they have dedicated time to review questions in the Google Doc and pair together to modify and check those answers.  This will help the whole team after all, you'll hire someone new soon eventually and that new person will need this doc in working order!

The first couple of syncs you were part of, and they went great.  Smiles all around, internal documentation improved.  Both Bob and Brenda seem to have improved their velocity.  This has gone great!  Time to let Bob and Brenda keep up the good work on their own.

Fast forward a month, and the situation is degrading.  The first signals were both Bob and Brenda failing to meet their scheduled syncs.  Scheduling problems were the first cause.  Then Brenda reported that Bob has become unresponse on slack messages.  Bob reports that Brenda asks him to sync immediately when his Google Calendar clearly shows conflicts or is outside his working hours. 

Even worse, the overall mood on the whole team is down.  Nobody wants to work with Bob and Brenda together. 

Finally, at a team meeting last week, Brenda exploded with anger over a minor question regarding sprint planning.  The outburst was profoun enough that it had to be reported to HR with potential disciplinary action on the horizon.

# Introduction to the Underfunctioner/Overfunctioner Dynamic in Pychology
The overfunctioner/underfunctioner dynamic is a concept in psychology that describes a pattern of behavior often observed in relationships, particularly within families or romantic partnerships but can happen in any relationship between two people. 

It involves primarily an inequal distribution of "capability" between the two individuals in the relationship of question where one person is more capable than the other.  These two roles are named: The Overfunctioner and the Underfunctioner.

## The Overfunctioner:
The overfunctioner typically takes on a disproportionate amount of responsibility, control, or caretaking within the relationship. They tend to be highly organized, competent, and proactive in managing tasks and solving problems. Overfunctioners may feel a sense of duty or obligation to take care of others, often assuming roles such as the decision-maker, problem-solver, or caretaker. 

## The Underfunctioner:
On the other hand, the underfunctioner tends to rely heavily on the overfunctioner for support, guidance, or direction. They may display behaviors such as passivity, dependency, or incompetence in managing tasks or making decisions. Underfunctioners may struggle with feelings of inadequacy or low self-esteem, leading them to defer responsibility to others and avoid taking initiative. They may also exhibit patterns of learned helplessness, where they believe they lack the ability to effectively manage their own lives.

## The Dynamic is Mutual
It's important to note that the dynamic is maintained between both the Underfunctioner and Overfunctioner mostly unconsciously.  The Underfunctioner will display behaviors that illicit overfunctioning from the Overfunctioner. Conversely the Overfunctioner will display behaviors that push the underfunctioner to underfunction worse than they would if left alone.

The subtle and unconscious system that fuels this dynamic frustrates, anger, and upsets both the Underfunctioner and Overfunctioner equally.

# Theoretical Description of Tackling the Overfunctioner/Underfunctioner Dynamic
Therapeutic interventions often focus on helping both individuals recognize and address their roles within the dynamic. This involves fostering assertiveness and autonomy in the underfunctioner, while encouraging the overfunctioner to set healthy boundaries and relinquish some control. 

The pillars of intervention are:
1. Recognition of the existance of the dynamic
2. Recognition of the situations which trigger/fuel the dynamic between the two individuals.
3. Building individually tailored processes that promote healthy boundaries for identified triggering situations.
